# Notes CRUD Application with Vite + React

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Notes web application built using **React** with note service and route protection. Users can log in, view, add, edit, and delete notes.

---

## Features

1. **Notes List Page**: View all the notes with `Title` and `Created Time`.
2. **Add New Note**:  
   - A modal allows users to add new notes.  
   - Form validation:  
      - Title cannot exceed 50 characters.  
      - Content cannot exceed 200 characters.  
3. **Note Details Page**: View detailed information about a note (Title, Content, Created Time).  
   - Edit and save notes.  
   - Delete a note.  
4. **Login Protection**:  
   - Users must log in with a username and password to access the Create/Edit pages.  
   - Mock authentication (username: `user`, password: `password`).
5. **Note Service**: Notes are stored in memory or `localStorage` for persistence.
6. **Error Handling**: Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page with proper error messages.
